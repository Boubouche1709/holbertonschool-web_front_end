# 🧱 Advanced HTML Project – Techium Website

## 🧠 Description

Welcome to the **Advanced HTML** project!  
In this project, you’ll learn how to use **HTML5 tags** to properly structure a web page.  
There’s **no CSS or styling** involved — your page might look “ugly,” but that’s completely fine. The focus here is **on structure, semantics, and correctness**.

> 📝 **Important:** Details matter! Pay attention to lowercase vs uppercase letters and tag spelling — even a small typo can break your page or cause validation issues.
